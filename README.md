# YouTube UI Clone

This project is a clone of the YouTube interface, designed to closely mimic the look and feel of the YouTube homepage. It is intended as a frontend development exercise to demonstrate responsive layout, interactive UI components, and modern styling using Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Responsive YouTube-like Layout**: Includes header navigation, sidebar, search functionality, and a grid of video cards.
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, clickable buttons, and search bar UI.
- **Video Cards**: Each card displays a video thumbnail (using embedded YouTube iframes), title, channel info, view count, and post date, closely resembling the original YouTube cards.
- **Category Tabs**: Users can filter displayed content by selecting different video categories (e.g., "All", "Music", "Web development", "AI", etc.).
- **Profile and Notifications**: Includes mock profile image and notification bell in the header.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for the UI.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.
- **Embedded YouTube Iframes**: Used for video thumbnails and previews.
- **JavaScript (if any)**: No custom scripts are currently included; all UI interactivity is handled via HTML and CSS.
